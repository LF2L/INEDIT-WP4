    "Role": ["AIMEN is a manufacturer of large wood components and small furniture using robotic 3D printing"],

    "Presentation": ["The 3D Printing of Wood project is a use case of the INEDIT demonstrator. It takes the form of a physical infrastructure and a digital process pipeline. The physical infrastructure will include:  a multinozzle printing head installed in an industrial robotic arm, the auxiliary elements like a working bench and the printing bed with incorporated heating elements, and an auxiliary extrusion line to provide the wood-based filaments for 3D printing with the desired recipe. The digital pipeline is able to transform furniture designed using the INEDIT platform into a manufacturing strategy that allows for the seamless integration of 3D wood printing."],

    "Objective": ["The objective is to be able to print large and arbitrarily complex wooden furniture and to give the final piece different colours, textures and properties by modifying the material recipe."],

Presentation
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The 3D Printing of Wood project is a use case of the INEDIT demonstrator. It takes the form of a physical infrastructure and a digital process pipeline. The physical infrastructure will include: a multinozzle printing head installed in an industrial robotic arm, the auxiliary elements like a working bench and the printing bed with incorporated heating elements, and an auxiliary extrusion line to provide the wood-based filaments for 3D printing with the desired recipe. The digital pipeline is able to transform furniture designed using the INEDIT platform into a manufacturing strategy that allows for the seamless integration of 3D wood printing.

<td style="text-align:left;">
The objective is to be able to print large and arbitrarily complex wooden furniture and to give the final piece different colours, textures and properties by modifying the material recipe.

Presentation
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
The 3D Printing of Recycled Plastic project is a use case of the INEDIT demonstrator. It focuses on the recycling of plastic materials (technical and logistical feasibility) to produce prototypes and simple and personalised objects for furniture (ornaments and repairs). It involves local stakeholders and must identify the differences in plastic sources, considering the variability/heterogeneity of the plastic waste to be reused and its initial conditions.

Presentation

<td style="text-align:left;">
The Smartification project is a use case of the INEDIT demonstrator. It focuses on the integration of intelligent objects connected to the furniture in order to make the user’s life easier. It seeks to advance common manufacturing processes to become highly personalized and intelligent, thus contributing to a 4.0 manufacturing process that will foster the integration of furniture in an environment that becomes connected. Usage of smartification would range from environmental conditions (e.g. humidity, heat and movement) identifying critical situations (e.g. flooding, fire, earthquake) but can also assist in medical conditions (e.g. detecting a falling person or excessive permanence in bed or couch). The smart devices (comprised of autonomous hardware sensors capable of communication in IoT settings) can provide awareness of objects/environment conditions that surround the users, in order to enhance their quality of life and their user experience.

<td style="text-align:left;">
The Flexible Wood Work Center project is a use case of the INEDIT demonstrator. It mobilizes actors capable of advising and guiding customers through the design phases, it proposes a translation of design ideas and production instructions and it develops a new generation woodworking system with a great flexibility, ease of use but low manufacturing cost and environmental impact for very small lots and just-in-time production.

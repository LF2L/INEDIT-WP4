AIMEN:
  Title: 3D PRINTING OF WOOD
  Role: AIMEN is a manufacturer of large wood components and small furniture using robotic
    3D printing
  Presentation:
  - 'The 3D Printing of Wood project is a use case of the INEDIT demonstrator. It
    takes the form of a physical infrastructure and a digital process pipeline. The
    physical infrastructure will include:  a multinozzle printing head installed in
    an industrial robotic arm, the auxiliary elements like a working bench and the
    printing bed with incorporated heating elements, and an auxiliary extrusion line
    to provide the wood-based filaments for 3D printing with the desired recipe. The
    digital pipeline is able to transform furniture designed using the INEDIT platform
    into a manufacturing strategy that allows for the seamless integration of 3D wood
    printing.'

  Results:
  - Development of a Smart Manufacture in a DIT approach 
  - Development of a tool, a decoupling point between a co-creation digital platform and the production instructions
  - Proposal of a sustainability-driven design and manufacturing process 

  
  Participation DIT:
   Empathization:
   - A place for meeting with different stakeholders involved during the co-creation phase
   Project definition:
   - 
   Prototyping:
   - Advise of customers during the design phase to ensure the feasibility of their product’s manufacturing 
     (information about wood production process, choice of the accessories and materials, economic impact of the choices)
   - Feedback to the co-creation platform with new models/designs
   
   Validation:
   - Production of furniture piece
   Raw material sourcing: 
   - Supply of suitable components for the sensors
   Production: 
   - Integration of the suitable sensor in the final piece
   - Assembly of the furniture with pieces from the other use cases 
     (recycled plastic components (UL), wood components (AIMEN), intelligent components (UNINOVA))  
   - Use of several technologies from the other use case for the furniture production    
   Use and Recycling:
   - Runtime supervision/support of the sensor’s services  (Without Recycling phase)
  
   Transport:
   - Transport of the final product
   Delivery: 
   - Delivery to the final customer, installation and test of the quality of the product 
  
  Impact: 
  - I think we can be a “special Building”, where we can produce a furniture as a furniture manufacturer 
    (we are only a building of the INEDIT system), but “special” because we have some “building ISLAND” characteristics; 
    we have a centrality role for other “Buildings” (like for suppliers or like for the other use cases).
    With our potential “innovation hub” we can also have an impact on the Neighbourhood or the 
    District for the INEDIT system in the Ticinio region of Switzerland.

UL:
  Title: Distributed Recycling for 3D Printing
  Role: UL is a supplier of recycled plastic components and 3D recycled plastic equipment
  Presentation:
  - The 3D Printing of Recycled Plastic project is a use case of the INEDIT demonstrator. 
    It focuses on the recycling of plastic materials (technical and logistical feasibility) 
    to produce prototypes and simple and personalised objects for furniture (ornaments and repairs). 
    It involves local stakeholders and must identify the differences in plastic sources, 
    considering the variability/heterogeneity of the plastic waste to be reused and its initial conditions. 
  Objective: 
  - Provide a framework of smart objects to integrate to furniture for promoting a high level of customization according to the individual needs of customers 
  Innovations:
    Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM): 
      Description:
      - Use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling in the printing process chain. 
        Ideally from local sources (<2km) in function of the quantity and availability 
      Stakeholders:
      - UL for the development of a physical co-creation platform and the 3D printing of recycled plastic 
      - Designers as intermediate (technical) validators
      - Furniture producers
      - PMEs of UL territory for providing plastic waste to be reused
      - Users
    Smart collector of plastic wastes:
      Description:
      - Local plastic waste identification and selection using out-of-use electrical open hardware in 
        urban environments 
      Stakeholders:
      - UL for the development of a physical co-creation platform and the 3D printing of recycled plastic 
      - Designers as intermediate (technical) validators
      - Furniture producers
      - PMEs of UL territory for providing plastic waste to be reused
      - Users
      
  Results:
  - Development of a replicable Open Manufacturing Demonstration Facility for furniture 3D printing in a DIT approach.
  - Development of a pilot recycling platform based on an open design approach.
  - Proposal of a sustainability-driven design and manufacturing process.
  - Proposition of a cartography of potential plastic wastes based on data that could be recollected from a smart plastic collector.

  
  Participation DIT:  
    Empathization: Formalization of the customers’ problem
    Project definition: Definition of the project’s scope
    Ideation: Support of the customers in ideas generating
    Prototyping: Production of prototype for validation
    Validation: Proposition of customized object for personalisation 
    Raw material sourcing: Collection of the sources of plastics that can be processed
    Transport: Management of the transport of identified plastics
    Production: Transformation of the potential usable plastic wastes in functional objects
    Recycling: Recycling of the waste plastics
    Maintenance: Production of spare part for reparability

  Impact: 
  - The expected scale impacted is at Neighbourhood. One of the main drawbacks of the recycling process in 
    the embodied cost of transport, sorting and cleaning process of the recycled assets. 
    In a first moment, the main idea is to identify recycled assets that can be recycled, if and only if, 
    they are close to the recycled facilities and in a low contamination level, where processes of cleaning 
    can be implemented locally.
    In a Neighbourhood scale, the mean of transport considered to collect the recycled material are intended 
    to produce low environmental impact (reduced of C02). Today, the printing rate is of commercial desktop 3D printer is relatively low (about 20-50 gr/h). The idea with INEDIT project is to mount this value to about 1-2 kg/h, and based on this value, to establish indices of logistic supply
